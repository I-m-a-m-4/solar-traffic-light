## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated green (#90EE90) to represent sustainability and eco-friendliness. In hex, this is rgb(144, 238, 144).
- Background color: Light green (#F0FFF0), very desaturated to provide a clean backdrop, analogous to the saturated primary. In hex, this is rgb(240, 255, 240).
- Accent color: Yellow-green (#ADFF2F), providing contrast with the green primary while staying within an analogous palette to represent energy and innovation. In hex, this is rgb(173, 255, 47).
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, known for its modern and neutral look, which will present technical data clearly and cleanly.
- Use a single-page layout with clear, distinct sections for easy navigation. Incorporate plenty of white space to improve readability.
- Employ simple, modern icons that represent key features and benefits, enhancing visual appeal and user comprehension.
- Subtle fade-in animations on scroll to enhance user experience without distracting from the content.
